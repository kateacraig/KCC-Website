            <p>
              Kate knows that rural candidates are the least likely to receive
              resources as well as to have access to campaign staff. That's why
              Kate has decided to revolutionize the campaign process for rural
              candidates, launching a subscription-based service to help
              candidates develop their campaign plans, design their websites,
              and be able to have their questions answered by someone with
              experience.
            </p>

              Kate is a graduate of American University's Campaign Management

              and movement work.
